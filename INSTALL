Prerequisites:

	1. the CGAL library (3.1.0 and greater should work). 
	available from www.cgal.org
	2. the TCLAP library. this small library for parsing
	command line arguments should be included in this
	software bundle.

Compiling:

	1. edit the Makefile to have the proper location of your
	CGAL Makefile, for example:

	CGAL_MAKEFILE = /usr/share/etc/cgal/make/makefile_i686_Linux-2.4.20-64GB-SMP_g++-3.3.0

	2. compile the software by typing make.
	3. when that doesn't work, send an email to Steven Pav at spav@ucsd.edu
